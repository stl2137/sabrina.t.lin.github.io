# Project Overview

In a team with three other members, I was assigned to apply the data science skills and tools learned from the semester. 

The purpose and objectives of our project are listed on our website [link](https://abcdefg781.github.io/ds_final_project/index.html).

# Project Reflection

After completing this project, I learned the importance of synthesizing and highlighting results of interest garnered from our analysis. This hands-on experience with such a massive and uncleaned dataset taught me the importance of good data tidying, in addition to the importance of having clear questions in mind prior to conducting analysis.
